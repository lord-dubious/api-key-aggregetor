# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing Gemini API Key Aggregator to provide dedicated proxy assignment for each API key. The system will ensure that each API key uses its own assigned proxy server for all requests, enabling better load distribution, geographic diversity, and improved rate limit management across different proxy endpoints.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the API aggregator, I want each API key to have its own dedicated proxy server, so that requests are distributed across different network endpoints and reduce the risk of rate limiting from a single IP address.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new API key is added THEN the system SHALL automatically assign an available proxy from the proxy pool
2. WHEN an API key is assigned a proxy THEN the system SHALL persist this assignment across extension restarts
3. WHEN making requests with an API key THEN the system SHALL use only the assigned proxy for that key
4. IF no proxies are available in the pool THEN the system SHALL allow the API key to operate without a proxy

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer managing multiple proxy servers, I want to configure and manage a pool of proxy servers, so that I can distribute API requests across different network endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring proxy settings THEN the system SHALL allow adding multiple proxy server URLs
2. WHEN a proxy URL is provided THEN the system SHALL validate the proxy URL format (http, https, socks, socks5)
3. WHEN proxy pool is updated THEN the system SHALL redistribute unassigned API keys to available proxies
4. WHEN a proxy becomes unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle requests gracefully and optionally reassign the API key

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer monitoring API usage, I want to see which proxy is assigned to each API key in the management interface, so that I can track and troubleshoot proxy-specific issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing API keys in the management panel THEN the system SHALL display the assigned proxy for each key
2. WHEN an API key has no assigned proxy THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate "No Proxy" status
3. WHEN proxy assignment changes THEN the system SHALL update the display in real-time
4. WHEN viewing request logs THEN the system SHALL include proxy information for debugging

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer managing API keys, I want the ability to manually reassign proxies to specific API keys, so that I can optimize performance or troubleshoot connectivity issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN selecting an API key in the management interface THEN the system SHALL provide an option to change its assigned proxy
2. WHEN reassigning a proxy THEN the system SHALL validate the new proxy assignment
3. WHEN proxy reassignment is successful THEN the system SHALL persist the new assignment immediately
4. WHEN reassigning a proxy that is already in use THEN the system SHALL allow the assignment (multiple keys can share proxies if needed)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer using the proxy system, I want automatic proxy assignment to be balanced across available proxies, so that no single proxy becomes overloaded with too many API keys.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple proxies are available THEN the system SHALL distribute API keys evenly across proxies
2. WHEN a new API key is added THEN the system SHALL assign it to the proxy with the fewest assigned keys
3. WHEN proxy pool changes THEN the system SHALL rebalance assignments to maintain even distribution
4. WHEN calculating proxy load THEN the system SHALL consider both assigned keys and active request volume
