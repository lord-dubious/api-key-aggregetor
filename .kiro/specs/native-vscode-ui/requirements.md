# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature converts the current browser-based webview UI to a native VS Code extension UI using VS Code's built-in UI components like TreeView, QuickPick, and StatusBar. This change will improve performance, provide better integration with VS Code's theming system, and ensure compatibility with Remote Development and GitHub Codespaces environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using the extension, I want to manage API keys through native VS Code UI components so that the interface feels integrated with the editor and works seamlessly in remote environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is activated THEN it SHALL create a TreeView in the Explorer panel for API key management
2. WHEN a user clicks on an API key in the TreeView THEN the system SHALL display key details in a QuickPick or information message
3. WHEN a user wants to add a new API key THEN the system SHALL provide an input box through VS Code's native input API
4. WHEN a user wants to delete an API key THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog using VS Code's native dialog API
5. WHEN API key status changes THEN the TreeView SHALL update automatically to reflect the current state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manage proxy settings through native VS Code UI so that I can configure proxies without opening a separate browser interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is activated THEN it SHALL create a separate TreeView section for proxy management
2. WHEN a user wants to add a proxy THEN the system SHALL provide input validation through VS Code's native input API
3. WHEN a proxy health check fails THEN the system SHALL display the status in the TreeView with appropriate icons
4. WHEN a user wants to assign proxies to API keys THEN the system SHALL provide a QuickPick interface for selection
5. WHEN proxy authentication is required THEN the system SHALL securely prompt for credentials using VS Code's input API

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer working in remote environments (Codespaces, Remote SSH), I want the extension UI to work without browser dependencies so that I can manage API keys regardless of my development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension runs in a remote environment THEN it SHALL function identically to local environments
2. WHEN the extension is used in GitHub Codespaces THEN all UI components SHALL be accessible through VS Code's interface
3. WHEN network connectivity is limited THEN the extension SHALL not require external browser access for UI functionality
4. WHEN the extension starts THEN it SHALL not spawn any HTTP servers for UI purposes
5. WHEN the extension displays information THEN it SHALL use VS Code's native notification and status bar systems

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time status updates in the VS Code interface so that I can monitor API key usage and proxy health without switching contexts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API requests are processed THEN the status bar SHALL display current request counts
2. WHEN rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL show warnings in VS Code's notification system
3. WHEN proxy health changes THEN the TreeView SHALL update icons and status text immediately
4. WHEN the proxy server starts or stops THEN the status bar SHALL reflect the current server state
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display them through VS Code's error notification system

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to integrate with VS Code's command palette so that I can access all functionality through keyboard shortcuts and commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension is active THEN all major functions SHALL be available through the command palette
2. WHEN a user types "Gemini" in the command palette THEN all extension commands SHALL be discoverable
3. WHEN a user executes a command THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate feedback through VS Code's UI
4. WHEN commands require input THEN the system SHALL use VS Code's native input mechanisms
5. WHEN commands complete THEN the system SHALL update relevant UI components automatically

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to respect VS Code's theming and accessibility settings so that it provides a consistent user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN VS Code's theme changes THEN the extension UI SHALL adapt to the new theme automatically
2. WHEN accessibility features are enabled THEN the extension SHALL support screen readers and keyboard navigation
3. WHEN high contrast mode is active THEN the extension SHALL use appropriate contrast ratios
4. WHEN the extension displays icons THEN it SHALL use VS Code's built-in icon library for consistency
5. WHEN the extension shows status information THEN it SHALL follow VS Code's UI patterns and conventions
